# CuteLab DDSP Hub

Dockerfile for pushing DDSP training jobs up to [**Google AI Platform**](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/dashboard). The days of collabing and burning your local GPU are over! üç∫

## Installing and Training [CuteLab] üíÖ

First make sure you're set up with CuteLab's GCP account, as well as the GCP command line tools and local authentication. Make sure everything is up to date by running...

```
gcloud components update
```
Then log onto CuteLab's Google Cloud account, go to the storage section, and go to the _transference-dump_ gs bucket. Upload training data in the form of .wav files to the _audio-files_ folder.

Next, create a unique job name for your training job. Google Cloud best practices say that you should use the current date/time so that the name is always unique 

```
export JOB_NAME=cutelab_ddsp_job_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S
```

Finally, push the job to the cloud with the latest docker container from the container registry

```
gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training $JOB_NAME \                          
--scale-tier BASIC_GPU \
--region us-central1 \
--master-image-uri gcr.io/sinthomatic-music/cutelab-ddsp:latest
```
